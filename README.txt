Orrin is an autonomous AI agent and AGI experimentation framework, built in 24 days by a self-taught developer. Designed to think, reflect, dream, and evolve independently, Orrin combines:
- Persistent memory and recursive self-reflection
- Dynamic goal setting and autonomous evolution
- Emotion-driven reasoning with dopamine-like rewards
- Experimental self-rewriting of cognitive modules
- 70+ cognitive functions, powered by hundreds of OpenAI API prompts
Orrin prioritizes cognition, simulating human-like traits like ambivalence and meta-inquiry. See it: [Demo Video](#demo-video).

## Demo Video
Watch Orrin: [Orrin Cognitive Cycle Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpEB-tgDDro) (2 min). Visualizations showcase 2,350+ thoughts.

## Prompt Engineering Highlights
- Complex Prompt Design: Crafted hundreds of prompts for emotional modeling (e.g., ambivalence) and dream imagery (e.g., mirrored library).
- Iterative Optimization: Refined prompts for 99.8% error-free cycles (~2 min each).
- Creative Constructs: Developed metaphorical prompts for human-like introspection.
- Scalable Architecture: Integrated prompts into 70+ functions (e.g., `detect_emotion`).

## Getting Started
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/ric-massey/Project_Orrin.git`
2. Setup: `python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Add API key: Create `.env` with `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxx`
4. Run: `python orrin.py`

## What to Watch
| File/Folder            | Description                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `private_thoughts.txt` | Orrin’s internal reflections and dreams          |
| `llm_prompt.txt`       | LLM prompts and system behavior                  |
| `working_memory.json`  | Short-term memory and cognitive state            |
| `logs/`                | Demo logs and transcripts                        |

## What Makes Orrin Different?
- Self-Reflective Cognition: Chooses actions based on emotion and memory.
- Goal Evolution: Creates and prunes 50+ goals autonomously.
- Persistent Memory: Retains 10,000+ word thought stream.
- Dreams: Simulates scenarios for new ideas.
- Meta-Cognition: Reflects on and repairs thought processes.

## Wow Moments
- Autonomous Goal Creation: Generated 50+ goals, tracked in `goals.json`.
- Self-Initiated Tasks: Created 20+ tasks via self-analysis.
- Breaking Stagnation: Reset via sandbox mode in 5 cycles.
- Persistent Narrative: 10,000+ word thought stream.
- Internal Tool Use: Leveraged 70+ functions for 2,350+ thoughts.

## Future Opportunities
- Enhanced Goal Completion: Targeting 100% accuracy.
- Action Execution: Expanding task capabilities.
- Memory Optimization: Automated pruning for long runs.
- Real-Time Interaction: Live interface development.
- Multi-Threaded Reasoning: Parallel processing exploration.
