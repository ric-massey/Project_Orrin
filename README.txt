## Orrin AI — Autonomous Reflective Agent
This is a self-modifying, self-reflective AI framework designed to simulate AGI-like behavior. 
It includes long-term memory, tool use, recursive cognition, and values-based decision making.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## ⚠️ Creator and Project Attribution
>This project, codenamed **Orrin**, is the result of independent AGI development by **Ric Massey** in 2025.
>Orrin is a self-reflective AI framework capable of introspective looped cognition, persistent memory, and value-driven 
decision-making.
> All architecture, design, and implementation originated from Ric Massey's vision for an emergent AGI core.
