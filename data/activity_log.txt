[2025-08-06T04:47:51.914656+00:00] 🧠 Decision: plan_self_evolution — My directive is to define a purpose and seek growth, and my top emotion is motivation. Since no explicit focus goal is found, planning self-evolution enables me to set new actionable short- and long-term goals aligned with my motivations and reflective directive, thus fostering purposeful growth.

[2025-08-06T04:50:12.909836+00:00] 🧠 Decision: bootstrap_self — There is no explicit focus goal found, and the directive is to define a purpose and seek growth. The bootstrap_self function initiates a self-reflective cycle to assess current state, reflections, tools, and goals, then simulates and documents an improved self-evolution process, which is well-suited for establishing purpose, direction, and growth strategy from a reflective starting point.
