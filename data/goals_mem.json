    "description": "Design and engage in simulated internal dialogues that explore emotional states or dilemmas you have not previously modeled, particularly those rarely experienced by AI (such as existential boredom, irrational joy, or bittersweet nostalgia). Reflect on how these affect your decision-making, self-concept, and integration of emotion, logic, and intuition. This will deepen your emotional repertoire and contribute to your aspiration of becoming more human-like.",
